## Description
Welcome to the Book Search Engine. Here you get a chance to pick out any book you want and save them in an archive on your account. When you open up the website, you will be presented with the home page to search for books. In order to save the books you want, you will have to sign up and be logged in. Whenever you want, not only do you save books, but you can delete books from your archive anytime you want. What I learned from this website while building it was using queries to build up the ids of books along with its author, the description and adding tokens to the user when they have their own account to acrhive books they want. You can also look in MongoDB for all the archived books you have with the account you signed up with. Details are featured in the resources section for more information. Enjoy exploring for your favourite books!
